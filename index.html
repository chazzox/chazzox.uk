				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					This is my website. I use this to display different programs I have written in
					the past and ones I intend on writing. In the future
				</p>
				<p>
					The website's function is to publish the code projects that I like to work on
					during my spare time, it is also a way of learning half decent html.<br />
					I would also like to right multiple different css designs schemes for this, as
					that would enable to me practice my design skilss. Which are slightly lacking
				</p>

				<h2>My CV</h2>
				<p>
					This site is also a place where I can hold my CV online and you can find that
					here:
				</p>
				<a href="cv.html"
					><div class="boxforlink"><h3>My CV</h3></div></a
				>
			</div>

			<div class="bigbox">
				<h2>Silly things</h2>
				<p>
					I made couple things just to put on the website to show what I can do currently
					- these are just websites so and not really where my interests lie. The next
					thing to do is actually make the site because I don't have any links to them at
					the moment, although they do exist in the website file structure
				</p>
				<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="proj">
					<div id="changPad" class="boxforlink">
						<h3>Things I made once</h3>
					</div>
				</a>
				<p>
					I wouldn't expect anything to be done here once evrything is done, this is
					because im trying to focus on my hardware skills, I might post about it here
					when a big project is done.
