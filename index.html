				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Henlo, 
				</p>
				<p>
					The website's function is to publish the code projects that I like to work on
					during my spare time, it is also a way of learning half decent html.<br />
					I would also like to right multiple different css designs schemes for this, as
					that would enable to me practice my design skilss. Which are slightly lacking
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="bigbox">
				<h2>Silly things</h2>
				<p>
					I made couple things just to put on the website to show what I can do currently -
					these are just websites so and not really where my interests lie. The next thing
					to do is actually make the site because I don't have any links to them at the
					moment, although they do exist in the website file structure
				</p>
				<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="proj">
					<div id="changPad" class="boxforlink">
						<h3>Things I made once</h3>
					</div>
				</a>
				<p>
					I wouldn't expect anything to be done here once evrything is done, this is because
					im trying to focus on my hardware skills, I might post about it here when a big
					project is done.
				</p>
