it turns out that learning things from scratch is hard. this seems obvious on paper,
but when you're excited to get started on something new, its very easy to get ahead
of yourself.

i've been tinkering around with godot for a while now which has been fun, but i
haven't made any meaningful progress, and im still unsure about the different systems
and design of the codebase that im going to need to get things going.

I think i've been coming at this from the wrong way, im trying to only learn the
things i need to get the game working, instead of developing a good base knowledge of
the engine im using, and using those foundation to go from there.

so i've decided to take a new approach: switch to unity, and follow a bunch of
hold-your-hand style tutorials to really get a good understanding of what it takes to
go from 0 to full game. and then once i've got a good understanding of the basics, i
can start to experiment and make the game i want to make.

in terms of what st-lazarus is going to be, i think a good mvp is to get nice
movement basics down. that seems to be extremely important for a game like this. a
lot of our core experience is around this basic operation to it makes sense to try
and to it right.

it's probably a good idea to look to other similar style games to see what they do in
terms of game design, ive been thinking a little about what makes a new game worth
playing, and why people would want to play st-lazarus over the other thousands of
games released every other day on steam.
