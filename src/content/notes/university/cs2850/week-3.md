title: week 3 of teaching - inter-process communication
description:
    Processes often need to communicate with each other, for instance when
    collaborating on a complex task. This week we will start looking at Inter-Process
    Communication (IPC) and at how it can be implemented via busy waiting. The C
    programming lecture will focus on computer memory and the relationship between
    strings, arrays, and pointers.
