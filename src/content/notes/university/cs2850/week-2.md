title: week 2 of teaching - process and threads
description:
    This week is all about two important concept&#58;  processes and threads. You
    will see how these are used in the OS to realize the illusion that many programs
    run on your computer simultaneously. In the lab, we will discuss C data types,
    variables, and functions. You will learn how to write simple programs that read
    and write on the terminal.
